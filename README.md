This project is a LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM implemented in C++ that utilizes file handling to manage library records efficiently. 
The system is designed to allow library administrators to manage records of book issues and deposits, as well as add, retrieve, and update details of students
and books.

Key Features of this project includes:
Admin Access: The system provides an admin interface for managing student and book records. The admin can perform tasks such as adding new records,
modifying existing ones, and deleting unnecessary records.
File Handling: The library's data, including student and book details, is stored persistently in separate files. This ensures that all information is retained
even after the program is closed and can be retrieved or updated as needed.
Book Issue: The system allows books to be issued to students, updating the records accordingly. 
Book Deposit: When a student returns a book, the system updates the records to reflect the deposit. 
If a book is returned after some defined days, a fine is calculated and imposed based on the delay.
